Yet Another Website Generator. [Powers my personal site](https://shanti.wtf).

## Why?

I'm tired of using large, bloated website generators when all I want is a
really simple and stupid website generator of my own. This is my riff on the
Makefile-based static site generator.

## How?

I'm testing this locally using [h2o](h2o.yaml).
