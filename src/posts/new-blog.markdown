# New Blog Smell

One of the things I want to work on at the recurse center is expressing my
thoughts in writing. Hence, this re-attempt at a regular posting blog. I'm
following in the good footsteps of some of my friends.

I'm currently following a variant of the [make a static site in 44 lines of
make][static-site-in-make] approach to building my own static site.

Through this journey I've found the [make reference sheet][make-reference] to
be invaluable.

The code for this blog can be found [here][yawg-blog].

As of the time of this post, I've gotten everything working using exclusively
Makefiles. No shell scripts required!

You'll notice that I also support AsciiDoc in this project. AsciiDoc appeals on
both as a contrarian and also on a pragmatic level: I like the formatting
primitives better (why is `__butt__` bold and `*lol*` italic in Markdown?).

Throughout this process I have been frustrated by the seeming stagnation in
AsciiDoc development. It might be fun to try to write a parser in a more
performant language for AsciiDoc.
