# Learning how to Photograph (links broken)

Recently, in an unsurprising move of pseudo-pragmatic contrarianism, I purchased a film camera. Shortly thereafter, I purchased some rolls of film and maladroitly shot my way across New York City.

This is an arrangement of my results, from most to least terrible. Captions are provided for your edification and amusement.

Not that you care, but everything you see here was shot on a very used Minolta XG-M with a 50mm f/1.7 MD ROKKOR-X (1st gen) lens on Fuji Superia 400 film. The negatives were developed at Luster Photo & Digital and then scanned in my apartment with a CanoScan 9000F.

## The Worst

![](IMG_0026.tif)

A good number of the photos I did not bother to upload look like this: a stupid, out-of-focus shot of my pigsty of an apartment. In fact, this is one of the most coherent pictures of that variety.

This was me discovering what the 1-second exposure setting looked like. Neat, but I don't think I can take advantage of it without a way to anchor my camera.

The biggest tool in my apartment is on the other side of this viewfinder.

![](IMG_0036.tif)

Heck, I apparently can't even wind film properly.

## The Not-Quite-Worst

Having learned what most of the buttons on my camera did, I decided to continue taking blurry and underexposed pictures outside my home as well.

Boring, blurry plants.

A near-sighted interior shot at [The Brooklyn Strategist](bk_strategist).

Lighting, angles, exposure, focus: this photo misses them all.

I spent 1/3 of a roll of film and all of the patience of these gentlemen trying to make this shot work. Never ended up with something I liked.

I just kept trying to get a good shot of this weird tree.

New York City is a city with cars, buildings, and people.

Now _that's_ my kind of law.

More buildings. More cars.

Of course, New York is nothing without its failing subway system. MTA's maintenance efforts are as unfocused as this picture.

How much are you willing to pay for reasonable transit? (death by taxi provided at no extra cost)

Immediately after taking this picture of clouds I signed a 2-year lease in Williamsburg.

Only in NYC would a squirrel pause halfway down a tree just to mean mug me for thirty seconds.

This performance at the Hester Street Fair was even weirder than it looked.

Some small park with a tiny child running around.

I think this tree outside my apartment was from a 135mm lens.

The Delancey Bridge, connecting East Manhattan to Very East Manhattan, is responsible for 70% of all hipsters in NYC.

The original artist makes excellent use of perspective and foreshortening in this composition.

I really don't know why I photographed this graffiti on the Manhattan Bridge.

## The Least-Terrible

Starting off, a trio of bepfeppers. The indoor colors are really warm for some reason, and Sharell is still a victim of my unsteady hands, but hey, these are some cool peeps.

![](/IMG_0008.tif)

They're _such_ cool peeps.

Flowers are some of my favorite things. There's apparently still a couple alive in Manhattan.

How can one improve upon Mother Nature's gifts?

Just add Skulls.
